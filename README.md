The Android Decompile is a script that combines different tools for successfully decompiling any Android package (APK) to it's Java source-code and resources (including the AndroidManifest.xml, 9-patches, layout files,...).

To accomplish the goal of a full decompile we use these tools:

- android-apktool : Version 1.5.2
- JD-Core-Java : Version 1.2
- Artistic Style (astyle) : Version 2.04

The tools has been built on Mac, but most of it should work on all UNIX environments!
Code formatting is not guaranteed to work on all platforms.
